So I have finally got around to creating my first post. My site is up and running and just waiting for content. I have to say that it was a challenge for someone new to Github. Each step required learning something new, but my most valuable learning experience was tackling the command line (terminal). Prior to this I had only used it to compile and run code.  
## What was the hardest thing to do?
The most difficult thing for me was pushing my site to Github. I can't recall the errors I got, but they were numerous. I had downloaded several themes before choosing this one. When I finally managed to push my empty theme, I found a non styled page. Just another of the many problems that I encountered. 

## So what will the next blog post be about
This one is short and sweet. Mainly because I have spent most of the day preparing my site. However, this post, if extended and elaborated on could make an excellent article, complete with pictures and video. As for an actual new post, I'm not sure. Watch this space.
