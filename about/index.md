My name is Joanna and I'm a gamer and a programmer. My love of gaming led me to discover programming. It was a late discovery. I wasn't one of those people with Atari and Commodores. By the time those came out I was already working in my first job, which was so far away from the Technology sector that I hadn't even heard of them. 
My interest in programming began in 1996. The year when I got my first PC. I can't remember the make of the pc but I do know it was running windows 3.1. I can still remember looking at this giant hulk of a grey thing sitting on my kitchen table and wondering "Now what do I do with it?" PC's were the new "must have" items, but I could not see it's usefulness. Writing documents was slow because I was only learning to type. Also what use what these documents? how could I show someone what I had done without carrying floppy disks around, and even then, that was useless unless someone else had a pc.
After much querying, I found out that Windows 3.1 came with something called Qbasic..and so it began. 
## The purpose of this website is all about the following:

* A portfolio to showcase my programming work. 
* A programming and tech related personal blog.
* Finally, a challenge for myself.
